	    are learned through education or hands-on experience.Examples of hard skills include security complience, blueprint reading, programming, computer 
	    skills, data visualization or cost-benefit analysis. These are concrete, measurable abilities that are often specific to a job or a domain.

skill_def = Green skills include technical knowledge, expertise and abilities that enable the effective use of green technologies and processes in professional settings. They draw on a range of knowledge,

	    'Green transversal skills' include, for instance, the evaluation of the environmental impact of personal behaviour and the adoption of ways 
	    to boost biodiversity and animal welfare. Green skills may be desribed by more than one or two words.
